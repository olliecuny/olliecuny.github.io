        <p>A newly created map visualizes traffic fatalities in New York City in 2024. It highlights the locations and casualty numbers involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. The <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data">NYPD dataset</a> underscores the urgency of addressing traffic safety in the city.</p>

        <p>The deadliest collision caused five deaths in a two-car accident. It occurred just hours into 2024, on January 1, on the northbound side of the Cross Island Parkway, near the merge onto the southbound Whitestone Expressway near Exit 36 South, police reported.</p>

        <p>The driver of one of the two vehicles involved in the collision, 24-year-old Kazeem Ramsahai of Raeford, North Carolina, was killed along with his four Queens passengers. An investigation found that Ramsahai was driving a Mazda at high speed while intoxicated when he crashed into a Honda, resulting in the Mazda overturning and causing fatalities among its occupants. Meanwhile, the Honda's driver was transported to a local hospital in stable condition.</p>
        <p>Later this year, in February and August, two more people were killed in separate car crashes at the same spot.</p>
        <p>"This is dead man's curve," Queens resident Rod Snedecor told <a target="_blank" a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/cross-island-parkway-deadly-crash-queens-exit-36-n/">CBS News</a>. "It's a tight curve, it's always been. A lot of accidents."</p>
        <p>"I never use that, that exit, at all. I just try to avoid it at all times. It's just too dangerous for me," Queens resident, Loredana Liggio said.</p>

        <p>Another severe incident occurred at the intersection of Water Street and Jackson Street in Manhattan, where four lives were lost. An allegedly drunk truck driver, traveling at high speed, plowed into a Lower East Side park where people were having a Fourth of July picnic at the time.</p>

        <p>In the Bronx, vehicle collisions at intersections such as Viele Avenue and Bryant Avenue, Jerome Avenue and East Fordham Road, and Commerce Avenue and Newbold Avenue caused two fatalities each across the year.</p>
        <p>Queens has similar issues, particularly on 57th Avenue, where two deaths have occurred, along with numerous incidents involving pedestrians and cyclists across the borough.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn experienced several incidents, including fatal crashes, especially on major roads like Woodhaven Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue, each resulting in one death.</p>
        <p>From 2014 to 2024, East Brooklyn had the highest number of car crash fatalities. According to the NYPD data on the map below, traffic accidents in various neighborhoods claimed over 100 lives over the last decade. However, these numbers are estimates since many fatalities were not accurately recorded or linked to specific locations.</p>

        <p>Unlike the decade-long accident map, the 2024 car crash map accurately marks over 230 fatal crash sites in New York City. Recent statistics highlight the significant human toll of vehicle collisions, drawing attention to high-risk zones and raising alarms about issues such as speeding, drunk driving, pedestrian safety, and the suitability of urban infrastructure.</p>
